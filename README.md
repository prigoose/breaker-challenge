### Setup
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run server`
3. `npm start`

### Libraries and Technologies used
-React
-React Router (to navigate between Edit and Save pages)
-Moment (to format the uploaded date)
-Howler (to set up the audio)
-Axios and jQuery (for http requests)
-Express (for server)
-ReactS3Uploader (for allowing users to upload images)

### Next steps
Given more time, the next steps I would take are: 
1. Implementing Redux (currently, state variables are being passed down from App).
2. Adding tests.
3. Implementing SASS to keep CSS organized.
4. Adding a 'cancel' button, in case the user decides not to save their changes.
