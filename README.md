### Setup
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run server`
3. `npm start`

### Next steps
Given more time, the next steps I would take are: 
1. Implementing Redux (currently, state variables are being passed down from App).
2. Adding tests!
3. Implementing SASS to keep CSS organized.
4. Adding a 'cancel' button should the user decide not to save their changes to the podcast info.
