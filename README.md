### Setup
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run server`
3. `npm start`

### Libraries and Technologies used
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) (to navigate between Edit and Save pages)
* [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) (to format the uploaded date)
* [Howler](https://howlerjs.com/) (to set up the audio)
* [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) (for http requests)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (for server)
* [ReactS3Uploader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-s3-uploader) (for allowing users to upload images)

### Next steps
Given more time, the next steps I would take are: 
1. Implementing Redux (currently, state variables are being passed down from App).
2. Adding tests.
3. Implementing SASS to keep CSS organized.
4. Adding a 'cancel' button, in case the user decides not to save their changes.
